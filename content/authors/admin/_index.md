I'm a researcher and an associate professor working for [Telecom Paris](https://www.telecom-paris.fr). My research team is called [DIVA](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr/), we are a member of the [LTCI research lab](https://www.telecom-paris.fr/fr/recherche/laboratoires/laboratoire-traitement-et-communication-de-linformation-ltci). Let me give you some of my research questions :
- What are the conceptual and technological limits of large scale distributed systems ?
- How to leverage technology-mediated learning environments to enhance human learning ?
- What is the impact of large scale learning systems in the global education ?
- What are the best practices in learning ecosystems to acheive equity ?
- How do you take into account the human feedback in AI algorithms / autonomic systems / smart-systems ?
